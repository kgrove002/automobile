        <h1 class="heading">General Information</h1>
        <p class="text">
            The first self-propelled invention was created in 1769 by a man named Nicolas Joseph Cugnot of France. This device would be powered by steam and be the first of its kind. In 1876, a man by the name of Nicolaus August Otto would invent the first practical four-stroke internal combustion engine; this would be built into a motorcycle. The first internal combustion engine automobile would be invented in 1885 by a German mechanical engineer by the name of Karl Benz; this would be built into a three-wheeler and later in 1891, a four-wheeler car. These variations of the automobile would be used by the public to get from point A to point B at a far faster rate than a horse and buggy would take them.

        <h1 class="heading">Impact of the Automobile</h1>
        <h2 class="subHeading">Society</h2>
        <p class="text">
            The automobile would end up being one of the first uses of assembly lines. This would end up creating jobs and sparking the creation of better roads for transportation. Due to being so much faster than older methods of travel, this would give people more freedom with what jobs they accept because they could travel further for these jobs.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">Economy</h2>
        <p class="text">
            By creating more jobs, the automobile would offer more money to the public. This also created a market for gasoline, rubber, and then plastics. This would also create more services that would be offered to the public in the form of gas stations and convenience stores.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">Environment</h2>
        <p class="text">
            Cars would cause extensive damage to the environment. Due to releasing harmful gas from its combustion engine, automobiles would cause smog which would contribute to a greenhouse effect. This would end up causing the planet to warm up and in more populated areas cause the air to become harder to breathe in.
        </p>  
        <h2 class="subHeading">Politics</h2>
        <p class="text">
            When someone thinks about automobiles and politics, they may think of the taxes they have to pay on them. Or perhaps they may think of trading policies that are made with foreign countries. Automobiles actually played a major role in politics during the women's voting rights movement. The automobile would allow women to drive across the country to protest for their right to vote. This would greatly help women in their effort for the right to vote.
        </p>
        

        <h1 class="heading">Then Vs. Now</h1>
        <p class="text">
            There are many differences between automobiles from the past to automobiles in modern-day. The appearance and performance of cars have greatly changed. Automobiles in the 1900s would only have a max speed of fifty-three miles per hour. Today people can easily see cars that will break one hundred miles per hour for general public access.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The way we look at cars has also changed. With the rapid depletion of fossil fuel, other means to fuel cars were required to be found. This is why we now have electric and hydrogen cars available to the general public. While these cars are rather new and refuel stations are still being developed, these automobiles have a high chance to become the new normal for the future.
